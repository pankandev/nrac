# Not Really An Academy (NRAC)

NRAC is a project to make the most of the courses published on YouTube. Paste the link to a playlist you are interested in and get access to new features.

All data is stored locally and that means: No account needed!

## Features

- Register your playlist progress
- Take notes associated to a specific video in a specific timestamp

## Roadmap

New features are planned:

- [ ] 🟢 Navigate through all your "enrolled" courses
- [ ] 🟢 Add markdown support for notes.
- [ ] 🟢 Allow splitting a course by chapters.
- [ ] 🟢 Allow renaming of courses videos (locally)
- [ ] 🟡 Add support for new content types between videos. e.g. Text

The colors mean:
- 🟢: Will do
- 🟡: Maybe?
